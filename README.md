"The New York Times" is a project created for Start2Impact where I put into practice what I studied in the React course.
All with the insertion of components as desired - including the addition of a superhero -.

You can try it [here](https://gilded-dieffenbachia-29ac42.netlify.app/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

#### Description
The site is a clone of the very famous The New York Times in which, using its official API, I show the main news of the newspaper with the addition of search functions.
We have three different types of menus plus a search bar and the ability to change the theme of the site (using the colors of Spiderman's costume).
Furthermore, we have the Login section where, through forms or buttons, you "sign up". However, being a clone site, I inserted a warning message of the impossibility of being able to do it for real, taken to the original site.

As for the "fantasy" part, Spider-Man's use on the site was entirely inspired by the color changes (like his suits) and the fact that he works in that industry (as well as always being on the front page as " be a threat").

For this project <b>React, Redux</b> and <b>Axios</b> were used for calls.

For the graphic part, I used <b>Bootstrap</b> and <b>Reactstrap</b>.

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
